Three studies (NStudy 1 = 134; NStudy 2 = 94; NStudy 3 = 161) tested the effects of a persuasive game on immersion, identification, and willingness to help. The results showed that playing the persuasive game did not result in substantially stronger willingness to help, relative to the control conditions. Video and printed text resulted in more immersion than the digital game, but playing the game resulted in substantially higher perceptions of embodied presence.},

In this study, player type determination tests prepared for Bartle’s player types were translated into Turkish by two English experts. The Turkish version of the items was revised by two field experts to best express the point of each item. Next, a scale consisting of 50 items was formed in accordance with the purpose of the study and the level of secondary school students. The scale was administered to 505 secondary school students, and validity and reliability studies were conducted. As a result of a factor analysis, it was decided to remove some items from the test, leading to a measurement instrument of 32 items in total. It was concluded that the scale developed to determine the player type for digital gaming environments was valid and reliable.},

  abstract       = {Background and Aim.Gamification is growing in popularity in education and workplace training, but it is unclear which game elements are conducive to learning. The theory of gamified learning suggests that one type of gamification, the addition of game fiction/narrative, can be used to improve learning outcomes, and the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model (TETEM) suggests individual differences impact the strength of this effect. From this theoretical basis, this study gamified a training module with game fiction in order to improve outcomes over the original training., Results and Conclusion. In a study of 273 learners, trainees were significantly more satisfied with training enhanced with game fiction over the control text (d = 0.65) but did not differ in declarative knowledge scores by condition. Further, trainees in the control condition scored higher on procedural knowledge than trainees in the game fiction condition, although the effect was smaller (d = −0.40). Thus, the use of narrative improved reactions to training but at some cost to training effectiveness. Attitudes toward game-based learning were also tested as a moderator of the condition-outcome relationship.},

Current research has focused on videogames, believed to have characteristics that improve learning. There is conflicting evidence on the benefits of using videogame-based training to improve learning. This study explored the impact of two videogame characteristics (i.e., rules/goals clarity and human interaction), on mid-training scores and post-training scores (i.e., familiar task and novel task). Results from a sample of 513 undergraduates showed that both videogame characteristics significantly impacted mid-training performance but not post-training performance; clear rules/goals and completing the training alone improved mid-training performance. There was also a significant moderation between the two videogame characteristics for post-training scores on the novel task, but not the familiar task, or mid-training performance. Findings suggest videogame characteristics have an immediate but not sustained impact on learning; implications are discussed.},

The SLR has been synthesized by reviewing carefully selected research studies published between 2014 and 2019 in well-reputed venues. Apart from reviewing the state-of-the-art studies on gamified solutions for recruiting and job training problems, a taxonomy of gaming elements based on the context of use in different environments has also been proposed. Similarly, the gamification model to develop gamified solutions to problems has also been presented. Lastly, the research gaps in terms of open issues have been presented to provide future directions for the researchers in the area of gamified solutions for recruitment and job training.},

However, little is known about the role of gamified assessment methods in determining applicant outcomes and, even more, their effect compared to more traditional methods. Using signalling theory as an overarching theoretical framework, the present study attempts to contribute to this gap by comparing the effect of a gamified situational judgement test which includes game elements, such as avatars, narrative and fantasy on applicants’ recommendation intentions through their organizational attractiveness compared to a traditional situational judgement test. Moreover, we suggest that these effects are moderated by applicants’ video gaming experience. Using experimental design, we found that the positive effect of the gamified assessment method compared to the traditional method on organizational attractiveness and, in turn, recommendation intentions was significant only for those with a high level of video gaming experience. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

This study explores the antecedents and outcomes of applicants’ attitudes towards a gamified recruitment tool by drawing on SDT and TAM. Data from 239 individuals who participated in a gamified recruitment process were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results show that applicants’ attitudes are associated with their perceptions of ease of use and usefulness, which are correlated with the tool’s ability to satisfy their needs for competence and autonomy and to promote autonomous motivation. The findings also confirm the association between applicants’ attitudes towards the gamified recruitment tool and their recommendation intention, their satisfaction with the tool and perceived organizational attractiveness. In conclusion, this study provides a theoretical foundation based on SDT and the TAM and empirical support for the use of business simulation games in gamified recruitment processes.},

  abstract       = {Background. Definitions of gamification tend to vary by person, both in industry and within academia. One particularly popular lay interpretation, introduced and popularized by Ian Bogost, and reiterated by Jan Klabbers, is that gamification is “bullshit” and “exploitationware.” They describe gamification as a marketing term or business practice invented to sell products rather than to represent a real and unique phenomenon relevant to a nascent game science. However, this view is an oversimplification, one which ignores a growing body of theory development and empirical research on gamification within a post-positivist epistemology. In fact, because gamification is so much more outcome-focused than general game design, current gamification research in many ways has a stronger footing in modern social science than much games research does., Aim. In this article, to address common misunderstandings like these, we describe the philosophical underpinnings of modern gamification research, define the relationship between games and gamification, define and situate gamification science as a subdiscipline of game science, and explicate a six-element framework of major concerns within gamification science: predictor constructs, criterion constructs, mediator constructs, moderator constructs, design processes, and research methods. This framework is also presented diagrammatically as a causal path model., Conclusion. Gamification science refers to the development of theories of gamification design and their empirical evaluation within a post-positivist epistemology. The goal of gamification scientist-practitioners should be to understand how to best meet organizational goals through the design of gamification interventions, drawing upon insights derived from both gamification science and games research more broadly.},

I credit this to a market proliferation of rhetorical or “fake” gamification, a process which involves the decoration of existing organizational processes with game elements but with little or no attention paid to the psychological processes by which those elements influence human behavior. For gamification to be successful, specific psychological characteristics of employees or customers must be targeted, and game elements must be chosen to influence those characteristics. In theoretical terms, legitimate gamification in management can be defined as a family of work and product design techniques inspired by game design, whereas rhetorical gamification is at best novice gameful design and at worst a swindle, an attempt to make something appear “game-like” purely to sell more gamification. Only by carefully distinguishing legitimate and rhetorical gamification can legitimate gamification’s potential be fully realized.},

Results from random effects models showed significant small effects of gamification on cognitive (g = .49, 95\% CI [0.30, 0.69], k = 19, N = 1686), motivational (g = .36, 95\% CI [0.18, 0.54], k = 16, N = 2246), and behavioral learning outcomes (g = .25, 95\% CI [0.04, 0.46], k = 9, N = 951). Whereas the effect of gamification on cognitive learning outcomes was stable in a subsplit analysis of studies employing high methodological rigor, effects on motivational and behavioral outcomes were less stable. Given the heterogeneity of effect sizes, moderator analyses were conducted to examine inclusion of game fiction, social interaction, learning arrangement of the comparison group, as well as situational, contextual, and methodological moderators, namely, period of time, research context, randomization, design, and instruments. Inclusion of game fiction and social interaction were significant moderators of the effect of gamification on behavioral learning outcomes. Inclusion of game fiction and combining competition with collaboration were particularly effective within gamification for fostering behavioral learning outcomes. Results of the subsplit analysis indicated that effects of competition augmented with collaboration might also be valid for motivational learning outcomes. The results suggest that gamification as it is currently operationalized in empirical studies is an effective method for instruction, even though factors contributing to successful gamification are still somewhat unresolved, especially for cognitive learning outcomes.},

  abstract       = {Games, which can be defined as an externally structured, goal-directed type of play, are increasingly being used in high-stakes testing contexts to measure targeted constructs for use in the selection and promotion of employees. Despite this increasing popularity, little is known about how theory-driven game-based assessments (GBA), those designed to reflect a targeted construct, should be designed, or their potential for achieving their simultaneous goals of positive reactions and high-quality psychometric measurement. In the present research, we develop a theory of GBA design by integrating game design and development theory from human–computer interaction with psychometric theory. Next, we test measurement characteristics, prediction of performance, fairness, and reactions of a GBA designed according to this theory to measure latent general intelligence (g). Using an academic sample with GPA data (N = 633), we demonstrate convergence between latent GBA performance and g (β = .97). Adding an organizational sample with supervisory ratings of job performance (N = 49), we show GBA prediction of both GPA (r = .16) and supervisory ratings (r = .29). We also show incremental prediction of GPA using unit-weighted composites of the g test battery beyond that of the g-GBA battery but not the reverse. We also show the presence of similar adverse impact for both the traditional test battery and GBA but the absence of differential prediction of criteria. Reactions were more positive across all measures for the g-GBA compared to the traditional test battery. Overall, results support GBA design theory as a promising foundation from which to build high-quality theory-driven GBAs.},

  abstract       = {Purpose Gamification is the application of game features, mainly video game elements, into non-game context for the purpose of promoting motivation and engagement in learning. The application of gamification in a pedagogical context provides some remedy for many students who find themselves alienated by traditional methods of instruction. The use of gamification could provide a partial solution to the decline in learners’ motivation and engagement the schooling system is facing today. Specifically, the college environment could benefit a lot from gamifying not only their graduate recruitment strategies, but also the college course content and curricula. This critical analysis of literature on gamification is intended to be part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. A proposed methodology in the study of gamification effect on motivation and engagement in addition to an empirical study on three college courses are being finalized to complete this trilogy. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach Themes covered in the literature review include: conceptualizing gamification, advantages of gamification over game-based learning, theoretical connections to gamification, motivation and engagement, connecting gamification to motivation and engagement, emotions and fun in gamification, player types and gamification features, gamification in action, and implementation guidelines.Findings The literature on the effect of gamification on motivation and gamification is still limited on multiple levels. There is a gap between theory and practice in the study of gamification. There is limited literature on the implementation guidelines of the gamified designs.Practical implications This critical analysis of literature is followed by connecting it to future research by the same author as part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. The second project, will be proposing a methodology for any successful design to provide a holistic understanding of the topic of gamification. Finally, an empirical study on the effect of gamification on students’ motivation and engagement in three college courses will be submitted to complete the trilogy.Originality/value This paper is a literature review, so there is a strong connection to literature on this topic. However, the synthesis of the themes and ideas are original. The literature review is extensive and covers the different aspects of the topic of gamification and its relationship to motivation and engagement.},

  abstract       = {Gamification is increasingly used as an essential part of today’s services, software and systems to engage and motivate users, as well as to spark further behaviors. A core assumption is that gamification should be able to increase the ability of a system or a service to satisfy intrinsic needs, and thereby the autotelicy of use as well as consequent change in beneficial behaviors. However, beyond these optimistic expectations, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on how different gamification features satisfy different dimensions intrinsic needs. Therefore, in this study we investigate the relationships between the user (N = 824) interactions with gamification features (immersion, achievement and social -related features) and intrinsic need satisfaction (autonomy, competence and relatedness needs) in Xiaomi and Huawei online gamified communities that represent two large technology product-related online brand communities in China through a survey-based study. The results indicate that immersion-related gamification features were only positively associated with autonomy need satisfaction. Achievement-related features were not only positively associated with all kinds of need satisfaction, but also the strongest predictor of both autonomy and competence need satisfaction. Social-related gamification features, were positively associated with autonomy, competence and relatedness need satisfaction. The results imply that gamification can have a substantially positive effect on intrinsic need satisfaction for services users.},

  abstract       = {Gamification is now a well-established technique in Human-Computer Interaction. However, research on gamification still faces a variety of empirical and theoretical challenges. Firstly, studies of gamified systems typically focus narrowly on understanding individuals. short-term interactions with the system, ignoring more difficult to measure outcomes. Secondly, academic research on gamification has been slow to improve the techniques through which gamified applications are designed. Third, current gamification research lacks a critical lens capable of exploring unintended consequences of designs. The 14 articles published in this special issue face these challenges with great methodological rigor. We summarize them by identifying three main themes: the determination to improve the quality and usefulness of theory in the field of gamification, the improvements in design practice, and the adoption of a critical gaze to uncover side-effects of gamification designs. We conclude by providing an overview of the questions that we feel must be addressed by future work in gamification. Gamification studies would benefit from a wider use of theories to account for the complexity of human behavior, a more thorough exploration of the many opportunities coming from the world of games, and an ethical reflection on the use of game design elements in serious domains.},

  abstract       = {Background. Game studies show a high diversity of university departments that contribute to the field. They offer a cross-disciplinary image that includes a range of professions. Game science is responsive to the needs of government institutions, to industry, and to individuals vis-à-vis institutions. That pragmatism makes the field issue-oriented, representing a post-normal science approach in a context of political pressure, values in dispute, high decision stakes and high epistemological and ethical systems uncertainties. The body of knowledge is not yet in the form of a cohesive structure: a game science paradigm. Thematic diversity, theoretical and methodological pluralism, and a strong focus on the instrumentality of games are weak credentials within academia, arranged according to analytical science (normal science) principles. Moreover, within the conventional academic settings, game science faces serious limitations, due to the fragmented positioning in different departments and faculties (Klabbers, 2009)., Aim. A comprehensive and coherent view on game science is needed that connects three levels of inquiry: the philosophy of science level, the science level, and the application level. Advances in physics have impacted on the philosophy of science, on modernism and postmodernism, and as a consequence, on game science. Being able to understand the current position of game science requires that we are aware of its scientific roots, and future options for research and professional practice., Method. Literature review with emphasis on theories of knowledge (epistemology) that focuses on game architecture, and the player’s experience. The analytical science approach to game science is insufficient to deal adequately with key questions societies nowadays are facing. Therefore, in addition to the analytical science, the design science approach to gaming is needed to be able to address issues that apply to various zones of practice, and related questions about social problem solving., Results. A coordinating frame-of-reference – a game science paradigm – is presented, independent of the instrumentality of games - taking into account the great variety of forms of play, and gaming applications., Conclusion. To advance game science, well-equipped game centers are needed that cover the three levels of inquiry: the philosophy of science level, the science level, and the application level. They should pursue a long term coherent research and educational policy, in line with the natural sciences tradition, offering both continuity and innovation.},

In our study, we focus on one single element in the form of digital achievements, one cornerstone of gamification, to gain unconfounded insights into the effects and working mechanisms of digital achievements. In a controlled experimental environment we investigate their impact on motivation and performance. Three research questions were investigated, first, if achievements are effective in enhancing motivation and performance, second, how achievements need to be designed to be effective, and third, if achievements' underlying working mechanisms resemble classical goal-setting. In three experiments, a total of 245 participants worked on different cognitive tasks. We experimentally manipulated several aspects of achievements, such as quantity and difficulty. We also compared achievements directly with classical goal-setting instructions. Results showed that achievements enhanced performance. Achievements also improved motivation, however only regarding persistence, not self-reported interest and enjoyment. The effectiveness of achievements was highly dependent on the design. Results suggest utilizing achievements with high difficulty and in low quantity. Results also support our assumption that achievements provide a direct goal-setting function. We conclude that achievements do benefit motivation and performance if designed properly.},

  abstract       = {Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified. Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field.},

The study was conducted in a technology-enhanced OCLL environment using a web-based e-portfolio system. The hypothesised model included two principal antecedents of behavioural intention introduced by TAM – perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use – in addition to the three psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness introduced by SDT. Path analysis was conducted to find the multivariate relationships between the constructs in the model based on the collected data from 162 Japanese EFL learners. The results indicated that SDT determinants could significantly predict perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, among which perceived competence was the most influential factor. Furthermore, perceived usefulness highly influenced the learners’ intention to continue technology-enhanced OCLL, which in turn influenced their actual usage of the system.},

  abstract       = {Business simulation games are a motivational and engaging tool for teaching business management. However, relatively little is known about what factors contribute to their success. This study explores the role of flow experienced while using business simulation games. Specifically, this research investigates the influence of challenge, skills, feedback, and goal clarity on students' flow experience. It also explores the impact of flow on generic skills development, perceived learning, and satisfaction. Based on a survey of 167 undergraduate students who used a classroom-based business simulation game, the findings show that the challenge provided by the game, students' skills to meet the challenge, and instant feedback positively influenced students' flow. Conversely, goal clarity did not foster the optimal experience. Flow positively impacted generic skills development, perceived learning, and satisfaction.},

This study aims to understand the effects of gamification on applicant reactions to and measurement quality of situational judgment tests. Design/methodology/approach In a 2 × 4 between-subjects experiment, this study randomly assigned 315 people to experience different versions of a gamified situational judgment test, crossing immersive game elements (text, audio, still pictures, video) with control game elements (high and low), measuring applicant reactions and assessing differences in convergent validity between conditions. Findings The use of immersive game elements improved perceptions of organizational technological sophistication, but no other reactions outcomes (test attitudes, procedural justice, organizational attractiveness). Convergent validity with cognitive ability was not affected by gamification. Originality/value This is the first study to experimentally examine applicant reactions and measurement quality to SJTs based upon the implementation of specific game elements. It demonstrates that small-scale efforts to gamify assessments are likely to lead to only small-scale gains. However, it also demonstrates that such modifications can be done without harming the measurement qualities of the test, making gamification a potentially useful marketing tool for assessment specialists. Thus, this study concludes that utility should be considered carefully and explicitly for any attempt to gamify assessment.},

  abstract       = {During the last decade games have arguably become the largest form of leisure information systems (IS). However, today games are also increasingly being employed for a variety of instrumental purposes. Although games have garnered a substantial amount of research attention during the last decade, research literature is scattered and there is still a lack of a clear and reliable understanding of why games are being used, and how they are placed in the established utilitarian-hedonic continuum of information systems. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of the quantitative body of literature that has examined the reasons for using games (48 studies). Additionally, we compared the findings across games that are intended for either leisure or instrumental use. Even though games are generally regarded as a pinnacle form of hedonically-oriented ISs, our results show that enjoyment and usefulness are equally important determinants for using them (though their definitive role varies between game types). Therefore, it can be posited that games are multi-purpose ISs which nevertheless rely on hedonic factors, even in the pursuit of instrumental outcomes. The present study contributes to and advances our theoretical and empirical understanding of multi-purpose ISs and the ways in which they are used.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Gamification is typically implemented digitally. However, digital gamification is not always possible because of limited resources and logistical problems. It is thus necessary to explore low-threshold gamification methods that can be easily adopted in classrooms. One such method is non-digital gamification using physical game design elements. Currently, the literature provides a limited understanding of the design and effects of non-digital gamification. It is also unclear whether mixed gamification (ie, a combination of digital and non-digital gamification) is better than purely non-digital gamification. We explored these topics using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design to compare the effectiveness of non-digital gamification in a face-to-face course and mixed gamification in a blended course in terms of student learning achievement, cognitive engagement and course satisfaction. Two secondary grade classes were randomly assigned to the mixed (N = 52) or non-digital (N = 52) gamification conditions. Contrary to our expectations, the quantitative results showed that the two approaches improved the students' learning achievement to the same extent. Although the students in the non-digital gamification condition reported significantly higher-course satisfaction than those in the mixed condition, the improvement in student cognitive engagement was significantly greater in the mixed gamification condition than in the non-digital condition. Through focus group interviews, we analysed the students' learning experiences and synthesised the factors that influenced student cognitive engagement and course satisfaction. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Gamification is increasingly being used to increase student engagement and enhance learning. Gamification studies have mostly focused on digital modes, which often require gamified digital platforms or applications. Non-digital gamification can be an effective method to foster learning, but the design and evaluation of non-digital gamification is at an early stage. What this paper adds We designed non-digital and mixed (ie, a combination of digital and non-digital) gamification programmes and compared their effects using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. Both gamification approaches led to a similar improvement in learning achievement. While non-digital gamification fostered students' course satisfaction, mixed gamification was more effective in improving students' cognitive engagement. Implications for practice and/or policy Non-digital gamification can be an effective low-threshold solution for instructors. It is worth further improving the non-digital gamification approach in school settings as it is cost-effective and can be transferred between classrooms. The benefits of mixed gamification should not be ignored because of its affordances that improve students' cognitive engagement.},

  abstract   = {Gamification refers to the use of game-design elements or mechanisms in non-game contexts to promote the expected behaviours. Though theoretically promising, empirical studies reported mixed results as to the effectiveness of gamification in educational practices. To understand this issue better, this author selected 44 articles on the topic of educational gamification with the use of a bibliometric analysis software HistCite, followed by a descriptive content analysis on these articles. This author examined three issues, including how effective the educational gamification implementations were in previous empirical studies, how the effectiveness has been measured, and what factors contribute to varied effectiveness results. One significant output of the current study is the redefinition of two terms: game elements refer to “the obvious game-like elements that are frequently used in digital games or gamification, which are concrete nouns”, and gamification mechanisms refer to “the underlying guidelines that make gamification activities engaging, which are abstract nouns that relate to humans’ innate psychological needs”. What’s more, the content analysis helped summarise a framework describing what makes gamification engaging, which contains goal, visualisation, immediate feedback, adaptation, challenge, competition, reward, and fun failure. Limitations and suggestions for future studies have been discussed.},

To comprehensively capture possible relationships, two vital theoretical frameworks -ability-motivation-opportunity (AMO) and affordance theory, were employed to provide theoretical guidance and a basis upon which propositions were established. A review of literature in the field reveals that gamified work system, through the improvement of ability-, motivation- and opportunity-enhancing practices supports dimensions including employee’s motivation and competence which are prerequisites for a creative outcome. Furthermore, contrary to the common opinion, work gamification could constrain employees’ creativity at work. Theoretically grounded in existing theories and past literature, this conceptual paper touches on unpopular discussions in the literature, opens a research avenue for further studies by providing testable propositions and recommendations for practice.},
